require mathlib from git
  "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4"

/-- `leanprover/comparator`, pinned to a tag; it builds against this project's toolchain.
Provides the `comparator` executable and, transitively, `lean4export`; both are built by
`lake build comparator lean4export` and used by the `test` driver below. -/
require comparator from git
  "https://github.com/leanprover/comparator" @ "v4.33.0-rc1"


/-- The development.  The default `lake build` target: `Challenge` is deliberately not one,
being ten `sorry`s by design, and comparator builds it and `Solution` itself. -/
@[default_target]
lean_lib SZ where
  globs := #[.submodules `SZ]


/-- The trusted statement of record: the certified theorems stated against Mathlib alone,
with `sorry` proofs.  Consumed by `comparator`, never imported by the development.

It states every lettered theorem of the paper, clause by clause, and leaves no definition
unspecified — `comparator.json` has no `definition_names`.  One module suffices: the certified
statements mention just two definitions, `SZ.MahlerZ` and `SZ.S`, both plain one-liners repeated
verbatim from `SZ/Defs.lean`, and everything else is written out inline.  Nothing here is a `def`
whose *body* contains a nested proof, so no auxiliary `_proof_` constant is generated and the
challenge does not have to mirror the declaration order of any module of the development. -/
lean_lib Challenge where

/-- The development, re-exported for `comparator` to compare against `Challenge`.  Three imports
— `SZ.Cells`, `SZ.CoverTree`, `SZ.ThmC`, the leaves of the import graph — cover all eleven modules
of `SZ/`, all of them sorry-free, std3 and cheap to build, so — unlike a development that
quarantines `native_decide` calls in an expensive module — one solution library suffices. -/
lean_lib Solution where

/-! ## `lake test`: certify the challenge/solution pair with `leanprover/comparator`

`lake test` runs comparator on `comparator.json`, checking that the solution module proves the
exact statements of `Challenge`, within the axioms that file permits, and that the resulting
environment is re-accepted by the Lean kernel.

Comparator needs three binaries.  `lake build comparator lean4export` produces two of
them; `landrun` must be installed once by hand (Go, Linux/Landlock only).  Each is
overridable via `COMPARATOR_BIN`, `COMPARATOR_LEAN4EXPORT`, `COMPARATOR_LANDRUN`.
See `COMPARATOR.md`.
-/

/-- The comparator config run by `lake test`, unless overridden by `lake test -- <cfg>…`.

A single file, as the submission format requires: it names both modules, all ten compared
theorems, and the three axioms of classical Lean.  See `COMPARATOR.md`. -/
